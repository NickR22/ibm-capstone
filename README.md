# Falcon 9 Landing Prediction - IBM Capstone Project

Welcome to the readme file for my capstone project on SpaceX, developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing data related to SpaceX's launches, missions, and rockets. The project aims to uncover insights and trends in the data, which can help in understanding the company's operations, achievements, and challenges.

The data used in this project is collected from various sources, including the official SpaceX website, NASA, and other open data platforms. The data is cleaned, processed, and analyzed using various data science techniques and tools, including Python programming language, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

The project is divided into different phases, starting with data collection and cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Finally, the project concludes with a predictive model to forecast the success rate of the SpaceX Falcon 9 landing.

Through this capstone project, I aim to showcase my proficiency in data science and demonstrate my ability to analyze real-world data and provide valuable insights. I hope this project can serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in SpaceX or data science.
